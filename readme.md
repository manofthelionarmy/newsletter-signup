# TODO:

- Instead of redirecting to a new page, why don't I do a modal with an overlay?
  - this would require me to create html elements via strings by interacting with
    the dom api.
- Create separate html file that has error state
  - copy pasta main html (index.html at root level)
  - add error msg for form validation
    - use flex to add even space between label
